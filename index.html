          <p class="contentHeading">What is <i>Next Gamers</i>?</p><br/>
          <p>
            <i>Next Gamers</i> is a student group within the MIT dorm Next House. We're comprised of a bunch of video game and board game conoisseurs that come together to play games almost every week.
            <i>Next Gamers</i> has both formal and informal gatherings. Sometimes we're hosting an event with snacks or a themed game night, other times a few people spontaneously get together to game in the evening or an individual can simply play a video game on their own.
          </p>
          <hr class="divide"/>
          <p class="contentHeading">How can you get involved?</p><br/>
          <p>
            <i>Next Gamers</i> typically hosts board game and video game events separately, so if you're interested in one or both, we encourage you to join Next Gamers! Regardless, membership is not a requirement to participate in <i>Next Gamers </i>events. If you do join <i>Next Gamers</i>, you become a general member (i.e. you don't join either half specifically), and can participate in any event freely.
            <br/> <br/>
            Membership is open to any currently enrolled MIT student. You do not have to live in Next House to become a member of <i>Next Gamers</i>. We have no dues or prerequisites for members, and joining is super simple! First, you can either email nextgamers-exec@mit.edu to express interest or add yourself to the nextgamers@mit.edu mailing list.
            Then, once you participate in any <i>Next Gamers</i> affiliated event, you'll be considered a full member.
            <br/> <br/>
            To get even more involved, you can run for a <i>Next Gamers</i> Exec position. We hold elections near the start of every Spring semester. For full details on the 5 Exec positions and how elections are run, refer to the Constitution on our <a href="./people.html" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline"><i>People</i></a> page.
          </p>
          <hr class="divide"/>
          <p class="contentHeading">What games do we have?</p><br/>
          <p><i>Next Gamers</i> boasts a huge collection of both board games and video games (for the PS4). Check out the <a href="./games.html" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline"><i>Games</i></a> page to see a full catalog of our game collection as well as instructions on checkout and usage!</p>
          <hr class="divide"/>
          <p class="contentHeading">Who helps run <i>Next Gamers</i>?</p><br/>
          <p>We depend on all of our members to keep the group thriving! As far as official leadership goes, we have an Executive Board of 5 Nexties. For info on the current Next Gamers Exec as well as a peek at our full Constitution, visit the <a href="./people.html" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline"><i>People</i></a> page.</p><br/>
